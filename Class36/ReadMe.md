## Lecture

This class is all about learning how to read 3rd party documenation
and how to apply that to an actual project.


### Authorize.NET

We will be using Authorize.NET as our 3rd party documentation to study and understand.
This documentation is extremely similar to what you can expect when working
with a 3rd party to intergrate into your existing applicaiton.
